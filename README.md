# Notes Explorer

This is a plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) that displays all your notes as cards for better visual navigation and revision of your notes. Explore your vault using the explorer view by using various filters.

>[!IMPORTANT] Notice
> Initially started as simple fork from the Cards View plugin, now has become a highly functional plugin in itself with a lot of new functionalities. I started integrating all these new features to explore vault efficiently. Although, now after hearing few suggestion from the users, I have decided to publish my own new plugin with all these new changes, as I presume, the author of the Cards View might not be interested in integrating all these new features. This Beta version will be now published with a new name : **Notes Explorer**.

## Features

- Display notes as cards arranged in a masonry view.
- Sorts by last modified time, created time and note filename either as ascending or descending order.
- Filter out empty notes.
- See notes from specificc folders using Folder tag. Also use sub-folder filter to view all notes from even the sub-folders.
- Click on folder name from file explorer to open the explorer view.
- Two different types of tag based color indicators.

## Installation
